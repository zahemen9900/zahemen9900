### Hi there, I'm Zahemen! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast from Ghana, currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science from the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah Unniversity of Science and Technology, Kumasi. My goal is to become a data scientist and contribute to the exciting world of data analytics and machine learning.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in data science and machine learning through online courses and hands-on projects. I've already taken a course on Python and data analysis, and I'm deep into my machine learning journey.

ðŸŽµ Outside of tech, you can find me enjoying a mix of pop and Afropop, and I'm also a gamer at heart.

ðŸ“š When I'm not busy coding or gaming, you can catch me discussing about my favorite soccer players and teams, and my favorite games. I'm always up for a chat about anything tech-related!

ðŸ“« You can reach me through my GitHub profile or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-yeboah-498245246/).

Let's connect, collaborate, and make some tech magic happen! âœ¨
